Oh, hello there!

I'm Val Pucilowski, a user experience researcher. I'm currently working alongside extremely talented people at Etsy, to help design and research both internal + external facing products.

While I'm not actively pursuing new opportunities, I do love building stuff on the side. Let's chat.
